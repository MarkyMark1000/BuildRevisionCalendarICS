# OVERVIEW

The routine should produce ? output files:

output_calendar.ics
---
This is a calendar file that can be imported into a standard calendar.   I have
found iCal unreliable, but try importing it into a google calendar.

output_data.csv
---
This is the calendar in ascending date order and topic.   It is the most basic
file format.
