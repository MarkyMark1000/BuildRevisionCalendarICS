# OVERVIEW

The routine should produce ? output files:

output_calendar.ics
---
This is a calendar file that can be imported into a standard calendar.   I have
found iCal unreliable, but try importing it into a google calendar.

output_data.csv
---
This is the calendar in ascending date order and topic.   It is the most basic
file format.

For sending via email/sms:
---

I have created a gmail account

email:   wilson.revision.timetable@gmail.com
pwd:   Wilson_ddmmyyyy   (currently williams birthday)

The calendar data output_data.csv has been loaded into a calendar.

There are 2 files attached:
output_calendar.ics     - For loading into calendars
output_data.csv         - Calendar events in date-time order
